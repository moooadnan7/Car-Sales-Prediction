Project: Car Purchasing Behavior Prediction
This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze customer data and predict car purchasing behavior. It utilizes a neural network model to learn patterns from various demographic and financial factors affecting a customer's purchasing decisions.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Uses Pandas and NumPy to clean and preprocess the dataset.
Feature Scaling: Applies MinMaxScaler to normalize numerical data.
Machine Learning Model: Implements a deep learning model using Keras Sequential API with dense layers for prediction.
Model Training & Evaluation: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure accurate performance measurement.
Visualization: Uses Matplotlib to generate insights from customer demographics and spending behavior.
Technology Stack
Python for data handling and modeling
Pandas & NumPy for data preprocessing
Scikit-Learn for feature scaling and model evaluation
Keras (TensorFlow backend) for building the predictive model
Matplotlib for data visualization
Use Case
This model can be utilized by car dealerships and financial institutions to analyze potential customers' purchasing power, allowing better-targeted marketing strategies and financial planning.
